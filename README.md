Observational research consists of systematic observation. “Systematic” involves a rational and reproducible procedure for collecting data. Data can be collected using a 
video recording device or a questionnaire. 

      The problem
→ 68% of Millennials, 81% of Generation Z (data from 2021) left their jobs for mental health reasons, both voluntarily and involuntarily, compared to 50% of respondents in general (34% in 2019 ).This contextualization is from a digital article by Kelly Greenwood & Julia Anas (2021): It’s a New Era for Mental Health at Work. 

     The Solution
→We see psychological tools being used in different areas, especially around Token Engineering Commons (TEC). 
After collecting the results from the survey, the next step is to analyze it and create a free application where: psychological help is offered, guidance to a specialist psychologist, techniques and practical methods in different areas. We consider it ideal to offer our services to other DAOs. Also we want part of the application to have a social function -Where people can talk about how they feel.
